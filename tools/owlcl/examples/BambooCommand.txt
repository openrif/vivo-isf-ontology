The following is only an example. It needs updating. See the actual eagle-i command in the eagle-i svn under eagle-i-dev/datamodel/trunk/src/tools/model-owl

java -Dowlcl.work.dir=/home/essaids/owlcl-work-dir -Dowlcl.output.dir=/home/essaids/owlcl-output-dir -jar owlcl.jar @EroBuildParameters


The above assumes that EroBuildParameters is in the current directory. Otherwise, the path has to be specified, absolute or relative from the current directory.

On the server add a -Dowlcl.arch.qualifiers=glibc2.2 to the JVM system properties shown above to load the Fact++ library for libgc2.2. Not tested.
